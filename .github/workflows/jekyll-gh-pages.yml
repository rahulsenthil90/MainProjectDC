    # The PHP-Prefixer PAT/Personal Access Token. The token must be configured in the PHP-Prefixer account. Example: `789|1234567890123456789012345678901234567890`.

    personal_access_token: 
    # The project ID to process the source code. The project must be configured in your account in the PHP-Prefixer account. Example: `5123`.

    project_id: 
    # The PHP-Prefixer JSON configuration to be applied to the project. By default, the prefixer uses the configuration present in composer.json. If there is no extra configuration or the extra configuration must be replaced, this parameter overrides the composer.json extra configuration to define the PHP-Prefixer schema. Example: '{"project-name": "Prefixed Project","namespaces-prefix": "PPP","global-scope-prefix": "PPP_"}'

    schema: # optional
    # Personal access token (PAT) used to fetch the repository. The PAT is configured with the local git config, which enables your scripts to run authenticated git commands. The post-job step removes the PAT.

We recommend using a service account with the least permissions necessary. Also when generating a new PAT, select the least scopes necessary.

    token: # default is ${{ github.token }}
    # Repository name with owner. For example, actions/checkout
    repository: # optional, default is ${{ github.repository }}
    # The branch, tag or SHA to checkout. When checking out the repository that triggered a workflow, this defaults to the reference or SHA for that event.  Otherwise, uses the default branch.

    ref: # optional
    # SSH key used to fetch the repository. The SSH key is configured with the local git config, which enables your scripts to run authenticated git commands. The post-job step removes the SSH key.

    ssh-key: # optional
    # Known hosts in addition to the user and global host key database. The public SSH keys for a host may be obtained using the utility `ssh-keyscan`. For example, `ssh-keyscan github.com`. The public key for github.com is always implicitly added.

    ssh-known-hosts: # optional
    # Whether to perform strict host key checking. When true, adds the options `StrictHostKeyChecking=yes` and `CheckHostIP=no` to the SSH command line. Use the input `ssh-known-hosts` to configure additional hosts.

    ssh-strict: # optional, default is true
    # Whether to download Git-LFS files
    lfs: # optional, default is false
    # Whether to checkout submodules: `true` to checkout submodules or `recursive` to recursively checkout submodules.

When the `ssh-key` input is not provided, SSH URLs beginning with `git@github.com:` are converted to HTTPS.

    submodules: # optional, default is false
